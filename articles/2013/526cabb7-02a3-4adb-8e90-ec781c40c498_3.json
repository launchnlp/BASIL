            "The proposal, which comes at the end of a month-long review process spearheaded by Vice President Joe Biden, is broken down into four key subsections: law enforcement, the availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety and mental health."
        ],
        [
            "In an effort to touch on all four of those elements, the president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales; reinstating the assault weapons ban; restoring a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines; eliminating armor-piercing bullets; providing mental health services in schools; allocating funds to hire more police officers; and instituting a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies.",
            "The cost of the package, senior officials estimated, would be roughly $500 million, some of which could come from already budgeted funds."
        ],
        [
            "Because these recommendations require congressional approval, the administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately.",
            "Those actions include requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system; providing law enforcement officials, first responders and school officials with better training for active shooting situations; directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence; and many more."

        [
            "\"I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality,\" said the president, speaking about his full set of recommendations.",

        [
            "The approach is so sweeping that what would have otherwise been a headline-grabbing announcement received second billing.",
            "The president on Wednesday will nominate Byron Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to take over the post permanently."

            "In total, the proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for at the start of Biden's review process, during which he held 22 different meetings with 229 different organizations and 31 elected officials."
        ],
        [
            "\"This is a monumental moment.",
            "It's a long time coming and we're thrilled the president's putting the full weight of his office behind this,\" said Josh Horowitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.",

            "The group continued its offensive this week, launching an advertising campaign attacking Obama as an \"elitist hypocrite\" for opposing the NRA's widely-criticized proposal, made after the Newtown, Conn. shooting, to place armed guards in all of the nation's schools."
        ],
        [
            "But that attack appeared a bit premature.",
            "As part of its policy recommendations, the White House called on Congress to act on an old administration proposal to spend $4 billion to keep 15,000 cops on the streets.",
            "In addition, the president is proposing a new initiative that would incentivize police departments to hire more school resource officers and encourage schools to hire more mental health professionals.",

            "The White House proposals, even officials there admit, are not a cure-all for mass shootings.",
            "Among the suggested recommendations on the gun-policy front, only the ban on high-capacity magazines could have had a tangible impact on the shooting in Newtown, and it's unclear what, exactly, the effect would have been."

        [
            "Moreover, the administration is pointedly not going after those weapons and ammunition magazines that are currently and lawfully owned.",
            "The proposal would instead affect the future production and sale of military-style weapons or high-capacity magazines."

            "The White House nevertheless insists that its package of proposals has teeth.",
            "It would provide law enforcement with the mechanisms needed to go after the illegal transfer of weapons and help prevent those weapons from falling into the wrong hands.",
            "It would also stem the use of military-style weapons -- the White House says its proposal would improve on the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which was riddled with loopholes -- and give schools and communities resources to address violence when it occurs."
        ],
        [
            "The question, in some respects, is not what's missing from the set of ideas, but what took the administration so long to get to this point."
