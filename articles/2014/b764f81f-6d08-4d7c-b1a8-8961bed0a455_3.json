            "The states of Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday, claiming that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law."

            "\"Federal law undisputedly prohibits the production and sale of marijuana,\" Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said Thursday in a statement.",

        [
            "\u201cBecause neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action,\" Suthers said.",
            "\"However, it appears the plaintiffs\u2019 primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado.",
            "We believe this suit is without merit and we will vigorously defend against it in the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d"
        ],
        [
            "Bruning, along with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, argue that under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional because marijuana remains illegal under federal law.",
            "The clause states that in general, federal law takes precedence over state law."

            "\"The illegal products being distributed in Colorado are being trafficked across state lines thereby injuring neighboring states like Oklahoma and Nebraska,\" Pruitt said in a statement."

            "The regulation of recreational marijuana -- as seen in programs currently in place in Colorado and Washington state, as well as those that will soon go into effect in Oregon and Alaska -- remains illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act.",
            "The states that have legalized marijuana or softened penalties for possession have only been able to do so because of federal guidance urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations."

            "With a majority of Americans now supporting marijuana legalization, and with states continuing to pass legalization laws, it seems unlikely that the federal government would push back against the legalizations.",
            "But it's not impossible.",
            "If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, all state marijuana laws, in any form, could be in jeopardy of being unraveled."

            "So far, the federal government has mostly taken a hands-off approach to state medicalizations and legalizations, but in January 2017, the country will have a new president.",
