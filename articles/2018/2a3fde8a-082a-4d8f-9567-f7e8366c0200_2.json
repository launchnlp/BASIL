            "WASHINGTON \u2014 Peter Strzok, the F.B.I. senior counterintelligence agent who disparaged President Trump in inflammatory text messages and helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies, Mr. Strzok\u2019s lawyer said Monday."

        [
            "Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the texts \u2014 exchanged during the 2016 campaign with a former F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page \u2014 in assailing the Russia investigation as an illegitimate \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d ",
            "Mr. Strzok, who rose over 20 years at the F.B.I. to become one of its most experienced counterintelligence agents, was a key figure in the early months of the inquiry."

            "The F.B.I. had been under immense political pressure by Mr. Trump to dismiss Mr. Strzok, who was removed last summer from the staff of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. ",
            "The president has repeatedly denounced Mr. Strzok in posts on Twitter, and on Monday expressed satisfaction that he had been sacked."

        [
            "Mr. Trump\u2019s victory traces back to June, when Mr. Strzok\u2019s conduct was laid out in a wide-ranging inspector general\u2019s report on how the F.B.I. handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in the run-up to the 2016 election. ",
            "The report was critical of Mr. Strzok\u2019s conduct in sending the texts, and the bureau\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility said that Mr. Strzok should be suspended for 60 days and demoted. ",
            "Mr. Strzok had testified before the House in July about how he had not allowed his political views to interfere with the investigations he was overseeing."

            "Firing Mr. Strzok, however, removes a favorite target of Mr. Trump from the ranks of the F.B.I. and gives Mr. Bowdich and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, a chance to move beyond the president\u2019s ire."

            "Aitan Goelman, Mr. Strzok\u2019s lawyer, denounced his client\u2019s dismissal. ",
            "\u201cThe decision to fire Special Agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical bureau practice, but also contradicts Director Wray\u2019s testimony to Congress and his assurances that the F.B.I. intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters,\u201d Mr. Goelman said."

            "Mr. Strzok responds: \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d ",
            "The inspector general, who uncovered the messages, found no evidence that the pair imposed their political views on their investigative decisions but cited that exchange as \u201cnot only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d"

        [
            "The report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, that preceded Mr. Strzok\u2019s firing not only criticized his conduct in sending the texts but also his use of personal email accounts to handle sensitive information. ",
            "In addition, the inspector general criticized Mr. Strzok\u2019s decision not to move swiftly to examine new emails related to the Clinton investigation just weeks before the 2016 election."

            "Mr. Horowitz said in his report that he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the text messages. ",

            "The inspector general\u2019s report also took issue with the reaction by Mr. Strzok and other F.B.I. officials to the discovery of possible new evidence in the Clinton investigation, known internally as Midyear Exam, in late September 2016 on a laptop that belonged to the disgraced politician Anthony D. Weiner, the husband of a top Clinton aide."

        [
            "At the time, Mr. Strzok was in the early stages of investigating whether any Trump associates had conspired with Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election, and nearly a month passed before agents and analysts began to act on the emails found on Mr. Weiner\u2019s laptop. ",
            "Mr. Horowitz could not rule out that Mr. Strzok had slow-walked the examination of the new emails to help Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential bid."

            "\u201cUnder these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,\u201d he wrote."

            "But the justifications for the delay were \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and had \u201cfar-reaching consequences,\u201d the inspector general said. ",
