            "President Donald Trump announced Friday a short-term plan that will reopen the government for three weeks so that border security negotiations may continue without the devastating effects of the partial government shutdown."

            "Trump said he\u2019s prepared to sign a bill to open the government through Feb. 15.",

        [
            "The announcement comes on the 35th day of the longest shutdown in United States history and is a clear cave by Trump, whose impasse over the budget stems from his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 a project Democratic lawmakers say is a firm deal-breaker."
        ],
        [
            "If funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period, Trump said he is prepared to shut down the government again or issue a national emergency declaration in order to get funding \u2015 a plan that would strip funding from disaster recovery efforts."

        [
            "Throughout the shutdown, Trump\u2019s reputation has suffered across parties as airports have grappled with severe delays and federal workers have gone without paychecks, putting many at risk of losing their homes, defaulting on loans and missing other crucial payments."
