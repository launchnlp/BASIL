            "\u201cWhile our sincere intent in voting for this bill was to create a shield for all citizens\u2019 religious liberties, the bill has instead been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword of religious intolerance,\u201d the senators said in a letter to Ms. Brewer, adding that the matter was \u201ccausing our state immeasurable harm.\u201d"
