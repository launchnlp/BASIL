            "Rep. Michele Bachmann has declined to get into the scrum with Newsweek over its cover story of the presidential candidate called \"The Queen of Rage,\" accompanied by an unflattering photo of the Minnesota Republican, but others are calling the magazine out of bounds in its depiction."

            "The National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill said that the cover of the magazine's latest edition is \"sexist\" and referred to a simple test by the group's founder Gloria Steinem to explain how they determined that conclusion -- would the magazine do the same to a man."

            "\"Who has ever called a man 'The King of Rage?'",
            "Basically what Newsweek magazine -- and this is important, what Newsweek magazine, not a blog, Newsweek magazine -- what they are saying of a woman who is a serious contender for president of the United States of America\u2026",
            "They are basically casting her as a nut job,\" O'Neill said to The Daily Caller and NOW confirmed to FoxNews.com on Tuesday."

            "The magazine posted other photos of her on its website, and many of them are flattering."
