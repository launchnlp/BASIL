            "Mr. Cowan, 43, who is known as Mo, is a former partner in the politically connected law firm of Mintz Levin and will become Massachusetts\u2019 first black senator since Edward Brooke, a Republican, held the seat from 1966 to 1978.",
            "His appointment makes Mr. Cowan the second black member to be seated in the current Senate, after Tim Scott of South Carolina was appointed by Gov. Nikki R. Haley."

            "Mr. Patrick had said he wanted to appoint someone who did not want to run for the seat later because that person would have to conduct a campaign while learning the ropes in the Senate, and would be unlikely to do either job well.",

            "The biggest question remaining in this drawn-out episode, which began last fall when Mr. Kerry\u2019s name surfaced as a possible successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, is whether former Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, will jump in."

Lautenberg of New Jersey, for example \u2014 lose their seniority, although the distinction has little meaning beyond a way to refer to a state\u2019s senators in the formal oratory of the Senate floor."
