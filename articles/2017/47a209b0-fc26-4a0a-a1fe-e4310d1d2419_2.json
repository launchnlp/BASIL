            "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee\u2019s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber."

        [
            "As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trump\u2019s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation."

        [
            "While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch.",
            "The Senate\u2019s \u201ccloture\u201d rule requires a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome such a filibuster."

            "\u201cAfter careful deliberation I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, citing concerns over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights and his degree of independence, adding, \u201cMy vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\u201d"

            "Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster \u2014 a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions."

            "Some Republicans have expressed reservations about changing the rules, but Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Thursday that he would relent if it meant seating Judge Gorsuch.",

            "To eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Republicans would need to vote in virtual lock step: The party effectively has only 51 votes right now because one member, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, is recuperating from back surgery, so just two Republican senators could block a rules change."

        ],
        [
            "Despite the escalating political friction, the atmosphere in the hearing room on Thursday was often more perfunctory than passionate, as panels of witnesses selected by Democrats and Republicans alternately expressed concerns that Judge Gorsuch was too conservative or praised him as a well-qualified and careful judge."

        ],
        [
            "Mr. Jaffer pointed to documents showing, for example, that Judge Gorsuch had worked to get Congress to enact a law stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear lawsuits by Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees, and in one email chain he criticized law firms that helped represent prisoners in seeking judicial review of their detention."
        ],
        [
            "On Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch told the committee that the email had not been \u201cmy finest moment\u201d and that he had been \u201cblowing off steam with a friend, privately.\u201d"
