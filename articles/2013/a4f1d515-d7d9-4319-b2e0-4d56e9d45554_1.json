            "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration tried Saturday to marshal new evidence in defense of its collection of private Internet and telephone data, arguing that a secret program called Prism is simply an \u201cinternal government computer system\u201d designed to sort through court-supervised collection of data, and that Congress has been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009."
        ],
        [
            "After rushing to declassify some carefully selected descriptions of the programs, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, conceded for the first time that the Prism program existed.",
            "But in a statement, after denouncing the leak of the data to The Guardian and The Washington Post, Mr. Clapper insisted it was \u201cnot an undisclosed collection or data mining program.\u201d",
            "Instead, he said it was a computer system to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the collection of foreign intelligence that had been authorized by Congress."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Clapper also insisted that the government \u201cdoes not unilaterally obtain information from the servers\u201d of telephone and Internet providers, saying that information is turned over only under court order, when there is a \u201cdocumented, foreign intelligence purpose for acquisition\u201d of the data."

            "He appeared to be attempting to push back against early reports that the government had direct access to the huge computer servers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and similar companies.",

            "But they acknowledge handing over material when ordered to do so by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, though they have not described the mechanism for complying with those orders.",
            "It appears the companies use some kind of electronic drop box, in which they place the material, so that the government can then harvest the information."

        [
            "The national intelligence director\u2019s rare Saturday statement was notable for what it omitted: any description of other means the government may use to intercept Internet information directly from fiber optic cables or satellite systems even before or after it reaches those Internet companies."

        [
            "A new report in The Guardian, published online on Saturday, cited another document that showed that in March 2013 there were 97 billion pieces of data collected from networks worldwide; about 14 percent of it was from Iran, much was from Pakistan and about 3 percent came from inside the United States, though some of that may have been foreign data traffic routed through American-based servers."

            "Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials, including the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of national intelligence, have held 13 classified hearings and briefings for members of Congress since 2009 to explain the broad authority they say they have to sweep up electronic records for national security purposes, a senior administration official said Saturday."
