            "Prior to this spring, the Internal Revenue Service did not recognize same-sex married couples pursuant to section 3 of DOMA.",
            "Once DOMA was overturned in June, the question became: What about same-sex married couples who moved to a state that didn\u2019t recognize their marriage (a couple married in Massachusetts who moved to Arkansas, for example)?"

        [
            "Thursday\u2019s ruling by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew provides a uniform policy for the IRS; the state of celebration -- where the wedding took place -- now trumps the state of residency when it comes to federal tax status for same-sex married couples."

            "On the flip side, gay couples also will now be subjected to the so-called marriage penalty, in which some (usually upper-middle class) joint filers incur a higher tax burden than they would if they filed as single people."
