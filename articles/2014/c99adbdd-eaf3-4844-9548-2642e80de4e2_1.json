            "In one of the highest-profile showdowns between establishment Republicans and Tea Party conservatives so far this year, Rep. Raul Labrador said Friday that he is challenging Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the House majority leader position that became open this week."

        [
            "Labrador, of Idaho, would be the Tea Party alternative to McCarthy, who is the whip and is favored by establishment Republicans.",
            "Only in Congress since 2010, Labrador would represent several firsts: the first Latino, first Mormon and first Idaho lawmaker to be House majority leader."
        ],
        [
            "Labrador\u2019s foray into the race for majority leader is yet another dramatic turn of events for Republicans, who were stunned by the defeat in Tuesday\u2019s primary in Virginia of Rep. Eric Cantor to a Tea Party candidate who cast the congressman as someone who embraces the status quo of Beltway GOP politics and did not truly represent his constituents."
        ],
        [
            "Americans don\u2019t believe their leaders in Washington are listening and now is the time to change that."
        ],
        [
            "And it upends the June 19 voting by the House Republicans for majority leader.",

            "Cantor, who had once been more moderate on immigration issues \u2013 particularly on the bitterly divisive aspect of whether to give undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. a chance to legalize their status \u2013 shifted sharply to a hard line position, saying he would block any effort in the House to consider proposals to give such immigrants a break."

        [
            "But some observers said Cantor\u2019s tough stance toward the end of the primary \u2013 one he\u2019d seemed confident he\u2019d easily win \u2013 was too little too late."

            "Nonetheless, many see the next majority leader as potentially influencing the House handling of immigration reform, which stalled as conservative members said they would not support a comprehensive measure for an overhaul of the system, and especially not one that, in their view, would grant amnesty to lawbreakers."

            "The Senate last year passed a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform bill that both tightened border security and provided a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria."

            "McCarthy, whose district is 35 percent Latino, has expressed support for providing a path to legal status, but only after those applying for it earn it by learning English and paying fines and taxes, among other things."

            "The Idaho congressman, echoing other conservatives, has said that Congress should wait until at least 2015 to take up the issue again because President Obama must make a clear attempt to take steps to secure the borders and step up interior enforcement of immigration laws."
