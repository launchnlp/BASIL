            "DES MOINES \u2013 Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday urged President Obama to listen to congressional Democrats \u2013 particular the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi \u2013 and make changes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that reflect their concerns about protecting American jobs and wages."

        [
            "In her first detailed comments on the trade deal since the House of Representatives refused on Friday to allow Mr. Obama to negotiate it freely, Mrs. Clinton laid out a far more calibrated position on the deal than many Democrats and Republicans have taken.",
            "She declined to take sides on the Friday vote itself but instead allied herself with Democratic critics of the deal \u2014 without actually opposing it."
        ],
        [
            "She argued that the House vote gave Mr. Obama \u201cthis amazing opportunity\u201d to seek concessions from Pacific trading partners to salvage the deal."

            "\u201cThe president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a rally here."

            "\u201cAnd if we don\u2019t get it, there should be no deal,\u201d she added."

            "\u201cI am willing to try now to see whether you can push to get rid of the objectionable parts, to drive a harder bargain on some of the other parts,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at the rally, her first here as a candidate for the 2016 presidential nomination."
