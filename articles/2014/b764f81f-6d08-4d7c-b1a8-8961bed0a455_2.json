            "While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, officials have largely allowed Colorado and other states to move ahead with state-run programs allowing medical and recreational marijuana.",
            "But the lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, where marijuana is still outlawed, argues that Colorado has \u201ccreated a dangerous gap\u201d in the federal drug-control system."
        ],
        [
            "\u201cMarijuana flows from this gap into neighboring states,\u201d the suit says, undermining their marijuana bans, \u201cdraining their treasuries, and placing stress on their criminal justice systems.\u201d"

        [
            "For months, some sheriffs and police officers in rural counties bordering Colorado have complained that they have seen more marijuana entering their towns and being transported down their highways since recreational sales began in January.",
            "Oklahoma and Nebraska said the influx had led to more arrests, more impounded vehicles and higher jail and court costs.",

            "Like many elected officials in Colorado, Mr. Suthers had opposed Amendment 64, which legalized marijuana.",

            "Nebraska and Oklahoma\u2019s challenge is aimed more at the commercial side of marijuana legalization, which created new systems of regulations and taxes as well as recreational stores, dispensaries and production facilities that are monitored and licensed by state officials.",
            "The suit does not specifically seek to overturn the portion of Amendment 64 that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession, meaning that portions of legalization could survive even if Nebraska and Oklahoma prevail."

            "The lawsuit, which was brought by Nebraska\u2019s attorney general, Jon Bruning, and Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, accused Colorado officials of participating in a \u201cscheme\u201d that cultivates, packages and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws while \u201cignoring every objective embodied in the federal drug control regulation.\u201d",
            "It was filed directly with the Supreme Court because it involves a dispute among states."
