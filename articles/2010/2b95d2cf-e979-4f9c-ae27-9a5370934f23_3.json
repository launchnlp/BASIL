            "Several prominent conservatives offered swift, negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday, after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama\u2019s choosing. "

            "It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.",
            "Republicans have consistently supported the effort.",

            "And not on a trivial matter.",
            "At a time when Gen. Petraeus has just taken over command, when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution, when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission, your comment is more than an embarrassment.",
            "It\u2019s an affront, both to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission they\u2019ve been asked to take on by our elected leaders."

            "Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is \u201c\u2019a war we have to win\u201d — a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: \u201c...you don\u2019t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who\u2019s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.\u201d "

            "But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit.",

            "Shortly after Kristol called for his resignation, a GOP operative began pitching the column to reporters, hoping that the meme of Steele\u2019s troubles would spread far and wide."
