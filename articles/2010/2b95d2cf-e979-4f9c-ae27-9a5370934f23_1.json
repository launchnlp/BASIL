            "WASHINGTON \u2014 Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, drew fierce criticism and a call for his resignation on Friday after declaring at a party fund-raiser that the United States was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan, a military fight he called \u201ca war of Obama\u2019s choosing.\u201d"

            "\u201cThis is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in,\u201d Mr. Steele said in a speech Thursday night in Connecticut in which he offered a strong critique of President Obama\u2019s military strategy."
        ],
        [
            "\u201cIt was the president who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Steele said, according to a video of his remarks that was circulated by Democrats on Friday.",
            "\u201cWell, if he\u2019s such a student of history, has he not understood that you know that\u2019s the one thing you don\u2019t do, is engage in a land war in Afghanistan?\u201d"
