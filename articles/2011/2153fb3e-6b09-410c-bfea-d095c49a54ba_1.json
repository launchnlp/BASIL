            "Mr. Obama singled out the Republican leaders of the House and Senate \u2013 Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader \u2013 just as he did in September when he visited an aging bridge over the Ohio River that connects their two states."
