            "The National Rifle Association called Tuesday for state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds once they've gone through extensive training, as part of a set of recommendations that capped a weeks-long review in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting."

            "Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, appeared to ease off slightly on the call for armed officers in every school -- he said it's \"important\" for every school to have at least one, but acknowledged these decisions are \"locally made\" based on unique budget circumstances."

            "Hutchinson, though, did call for the creation of a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers.",

            "The review comes as Congress and a number of state legislatures pursue gun control legislation.",
            "While a few have focused on school security -- South Dakota has already approved legislation allowing for teachers to be armed -- many have concentrated on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks and passing other measures to restrict access to firearms.",
