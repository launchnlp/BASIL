            "And the vice president made full use of his old Senate colleague\u2019s 1988 debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing pityingly at Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a latter-day Dan Quayle."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Ryan was no Dan Quayle, but he did make the mistake of mentioning John F. Kennedy in an argument over whether tax cuts recharge the economy.",
            "Mr. Biden flashed a Cheshire Cat grin and said to Ryan, after waiting a beat to let the moment sink in, \u201cSo, now you\u2019re Jack Kennedy?\u201d"

            "The vice presidential debate on Tuesday was supposed to be a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president\u2019s dismal performance at his debate with the Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, last week.",
            "Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama\u2019s rescue, relished his role, addressing his opponent as \u201cmy friend\u201d but dismissing his arguments as \u201cmalarkey.\u201d",
            "He laughed at Mr. Ryan\u2019s remarks so often and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his opponent."

            "It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night.",
            "Mr. Ryan tried to be respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare.",

            "This time he let loose.",
            "And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts.",
