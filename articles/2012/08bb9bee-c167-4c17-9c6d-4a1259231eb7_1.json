            "The vote puts the Republican Party at odds with Mr. Romney, who supports rape and incest exceptions, at a time that controversial comments by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, have increased national scrutiny on the divisive social issue."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Akin said over the weekend that women\u2019s bodies will resist getting pregnant from a \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d comments that have been widely condemned, including by Mr. Romney who called for Mr. Akin to withdraw from the race."

            "\u201cToday, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race,\u201d Mr. Romney said in a statement, citing former Missouri senators like John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth and Jim Talent."

            "Aides to Mr. Romney declined to say on Tuesday whether he would call on the convention delegates to reconsider their position on abortion.",

            "If Mr. Romney were to reject the party\u2019s tough abortion plank, it would send a politically difficult message to conservatives about how Mr. Romney might govern once he got into the White House."
