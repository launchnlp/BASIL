            "WASHINGTON \u2015 The House intelligence committee is preparing to issue subpoenas against Michael Flynn after the former national security adviser denied a request to voluntarily turn over documents related to the committee\u2019s Russia probe."

            "Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use \u201cwhatever compulsory process we need\u201d to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas.",
            "He added that the committee could issue additional subpoenas if other witnesses fail to cooperate, but did not name additional individuals."

            "Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynn\u2019s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trump\u2019s associates.",
            "The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynn\u2019s businesses."

            "The House committee\u2019s subpoenas \u201cwill be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,\u201d Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.",
            "\u201cWe need to use whatever compulsory mechanism necessary to get the information he possesses \u2026 the Fifth Amendment right not to provide materials or documents is limited,\u201d he added."
