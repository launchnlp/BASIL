            "Down in the polls, Texas Gov. Rick Perry is on the attack, claiming in a new TV ad that President Obama is waging a \"War on Religion,\" and he's the GOP candidate that can defend faith in America."

            "As President, I'll end Obama's war on religion.",
            "And I'll fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage,\" says Perry in the new ad titled \"Strong.\""

            "The arguments range from President Obama directing the Justice Department to stop arguing for the Defense of Marriage Act, to less substantive examples like Obama leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech this year."

            "Perry is a Methodist.",
