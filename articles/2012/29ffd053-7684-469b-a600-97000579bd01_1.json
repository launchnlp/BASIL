            "WASHINGTON\u2014Joining a chorus of Catholic bishops , theologians, priests, and social justice leaders, nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) to task for his misuse of Catholic social teaching in defending his budget, which hurts the poor.",
            "The group sent a letter to Rep. Ryan in advance of his appearance on the Catholic campus on Thursday morning to give the Whittington Lecture."

            "In their letter to Ryan, the scholars make clear they are not objecting to his speaking on campus, but rather his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds."

            "\u201cOur problem with Representative Ryan is that he claims his budget is based on Catholic social teaching,\u201d said Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese , one of the organizers of the letter.",
            "\u201cThis is nonsense.",
            "As scholars, we want to join the Catholic bishops in pointing out that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor.\u201d",
            "Reese is a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University."

            "The letter quotes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which wrote several letters to Congress saying \u201ca just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons.\u201d",
            "The bishops noted that \u201cthe House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria.\u201d",
            "Last week, Rep. Ryan dismissed the bishops\u2019 critique, erroneously claiming the letters didn\u2019t represent \u201call the bishops,\u201d a point the USCCB media office denied."
