Weiner, trying to put to rest a bizarre episode that is overshadowing his role as liberal pugilist and threatening his dream of becoming New York\u2019s mayor, emphatically denied on Wednesday that he had sent a suggestive photograph to a woman in Washington State but said he could not be sure that he is not the person in the image."
