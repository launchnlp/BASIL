            "WASHINGTON â€” Republican Congressional candidates on Monday intensified efforts to inject the divide over construction of an Islamic center near ground zero into the midterm campaigns while the Senate\u2019s top Democrat said he objected to the mosque being built there."

            "Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader and a Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight, said through a spokesman that those who plan to erect the Islamic center should look elsewhere.",

            "In a number of releases and statements, Republican House and Senate candidates challenged Democrats like Mr. Reid to make their positions clear on the construction of a mosque and community center about two blocks from the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City."

            "\u201cIt is very troubling to see President Obama again turning a deaf ear to the thoughts and concerns of a majority of Americans,\u201d said James Renacci, a Republican candidate in Ohio\u2019s 16th District, who said people at a recent public meeting were furious about the mosque proposal."

Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, said Monday that \u201carticulating the constitutional principles\u201d on which the country was founded and \u201ccalling for tolerance on the part of all of its people\u201d were part of \u201ca presidential act worth exercising.\u201d"
