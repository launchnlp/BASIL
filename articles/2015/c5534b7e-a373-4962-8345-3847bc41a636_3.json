            "In a letter to the Clinton\u2019s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to \u201cLibya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.\u201d"

        [
            "\u201cToward that end and because of the Secretary\u2019s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,\u201d Gowdy stated in the letter."
