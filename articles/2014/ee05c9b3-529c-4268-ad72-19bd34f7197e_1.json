            "WASHINGTON \u2014 In one of the most stunning primary election upsets in congressional history, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, was soundly defeated on Tuesday by a Tea Party-backed economics professor who had hammered him for being insufficiently conservative."

        [
            "The result delivered a major jolt to the Republican Party \u2014 Mr. Cantor had widely been considered the top candidate to succeed Speaker John A. Boehner \u2014 and it has the potential to change both the debate in Washington on immigration and, possibly, the midterm elections."

            "With just over $200,000, David Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., toppled Mr. Cantor, repeatedly criticizing him for being soft on immigration and contending that he supported what critics call amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally."
