Rick Perry of Texas is broadcasting a new campaign ad that seems to contrast Christianity with homosexuality, vows to end what he calls \u201cObama\u2019s war on religion,\u201d and highlights Mr. Perry\u2019s criticism of overturning the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy for gays serving in the military."

            "The Perry campaign did not say where the ad would run, but the focus of Mr. Perry\u2019s multimillion-dollar television budget has been in Iowa, where large numbers of Republican caucusgoers describe themselves as Christian evangelicals."
