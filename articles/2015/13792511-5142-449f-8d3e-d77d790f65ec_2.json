            "LIVINGSTON, N.J. \u2014 Gov. Chris Christie declared an uphill candidacy for president on Tuesday with New Jersey-style swagger, unconcealed disgust for Washington and a high regard for his own candor, vowing that \u201cthere is one thing you will know for sure: I say what I mean and I mean what I say.\u201d"
        ],
        [
            "Relying on his biggest, and perhaps his last, remaining advantage in a field of better-financed and better-liked rivals \u2014 his personality \u2014 Mr. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate in the Republican field who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country."

            "\u201cWe need strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office,\u201d he said."
        ],
        [
            "Pacing the stage without a prepared text and raising his voice to a shout at times, he vowed to campaign and govern as a colorful teller of difficult truths, even if \u201cit makes you cringe every once in a while.\u201d"
        ],
        [
            "\u201cI am not running for president of the United States as surrogate for being elected prom king of America,\u201d Mr. Christie said inside the gymnasium at the high school where he was president of his class all three years."

        [
            "\u201cI am not going to be the most popular guy who looks into your eye every day and says what you want to hear,\u201d he continued."

            "Trying to claw his way back to the top of the Republican field, Mr. Christie took a pointed swipe at his rivals who are in the United States Senate, like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have never run a state government."
        ],
        [
            "\u201cUnlike some people who offer themselves for president in 2016, you won\u2019t have to wonder whether I can do it or not,\u201d he said, invoking the \u201ceconomic calamity\u201d he said he inherited in 2010 and the \u201cunprecedented natural disaster,\u201d Hurricane Sandy, that he weathered as governor."
        ],
        [
            "But he reserved his deepest disdain for Congress and for the president\u2019s stewardship of foreign affairs, and extended that critique to President Obama\u2019s former secretary of state."

        [
            "\u201cAfter seven years of a weak and feckless foreign policy run by Barack Obama, we better not turn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Christie said."

        [
            "Still, he blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington.",
            "\u201cIf Washington and Adams and Jefferson believed that compromise was a dirty word, we\u2019d still be under the crown of England,\u201d he said."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Christie, whose dazzling rise as a national Republican in his first term was matched only by his spectacular loss of stature at home in his second, entered the presidential race bearing little resemblance to the candidate he once expected to be."

            "The economic recovery he promised has turned into a cascade of ugly credit downgrades and anemic job growth.",
            "The state pension system he vowed to fix has descended into a morass of missed payments and lawsuits.",
            "The administration he pledged would be a paragon of ethics has instead conspired to mire an entire town in traffic and the governor\u2019s office in scandal."

        [
            "Three and a half years ago, Mr. Christie seemed such an antidote to all that ailed the Republican brand that senior figures in the party pleaded with him to run for president as a substitute for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney."
        ],
        [
            "But now, a staggering 55 percent of Republican primary voters say that they cannot envision voting for Mr. Christie, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll.",

            "With two pillars of his presidential run \u2014 his record and his judgment \u2014 looking wobbly, Mr. Christie must now build a campaign around his most raw and prodigious asset: his personality, a magnetic mix of quick-witted charm, insult-trading banter, vulnerability, empathy and effrontery."

            "It was on vivid display Tuesday before hundreds of supporters, including many of Mr. Christie\u2019s oldest friends and most loyal aides.",

            "Mr. Christie, 52, honed his political technique, and developed a YouTube following, during a remarkable run of 137 town-hall-style meetings across New Jersey.",
            "Not surprisingly, he plans to put the town hall meeting at the center of his candidacy \u2014 and to put his hopes in a state, New Hampshire, that is famed for its own town hall meetings.",
            "He is forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states that usually follows a formal announcement, aides said.",
            "Instead, Mr. Christie will plant himself in New Hampshire for a week, holding one town hall after another."

            "As a centrist candidate from the Northeast, he would have a difficult path to the Republican presidential nomination under the best circumstances.",
            "And circumstances are anything but optimal for him: He faces a wide field of candidates, including several who are better financed and beloved by mainstream donors (Jeb Bush), hold greater appeal to conservative voters who dominate the primary process (Scott Walker), are agile public speakers with persuasive biographies (Mr. Rubio), or are better liked by Republican voters (all of the above)."
        ],
        [
            "At his announcement, Mr. Christie sought political rebirth, as he has before, by relying on his powers as a narrator, and mythologizer, of his own story."
        ],
        [
            "Running for president is a new and bigger stage, though, and both Mr. Christie\u2019s stagecraft and his oratory showed room for improvement.",
            "The first speaker who preceded him to the stage had no microphone, causing a delay; later on, she was booed when she disclosed that she was a Democrat."

            "\u201cThink about how amazing this country is,\u201d Mr. Christie said.",

            "The question for Mr. Christie, after a bruising year of watching his story rewritten by others, may be whether Republican voters, who can choose from among a long and intriguing list of fresher faces, will give him a fighting chance to sell himself anew."
