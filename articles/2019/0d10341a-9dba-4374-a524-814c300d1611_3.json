            "Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump\u2019s claims.",
            "Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall.",
