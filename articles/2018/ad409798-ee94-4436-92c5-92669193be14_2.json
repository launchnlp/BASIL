            "BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. \u2014 President Trump said on Saturday that conservative voices were being unfairly censored on social media, hinting that he might intervene if his allies\u2019 accounts continued to be shut down."

            "Social media companies, facing pressure from lawmakers and users over their role in the rise of misinformation and partisan division, have promised to step up their enforcement practices. ",
            "They have banned a number of pages and accounts in recent weeks for being involved in activity intended to disrupt the midterm elections, and almost all of the major platforms removed content from Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, this month over what they called hateful and violent speech."
        ],
        [
            "After the content from Mr. Jones and his website, Infowars, was removed, he issued a plea to Mr. Trump to block the companies\u2019 actions and \u201ccome out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue.\u201d"

            "Last month, he joined with prominent conservatives who have seized on the heightened enforcement of guidelines and the concept of shadow banning on Twitter \u2014 making social media posts invisible to everyone except the posters themselves \u2014 as proof of biased attacks on their views."
