            "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart."

        [
            "Even some justices who seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs expressed qualms about how to administer a lawsuit involving as many as 1.5 million women seeking back pay that could amount to billions of dollars.",
            "Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward."
        ],
        [
            "The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination."

        [
            "The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the court\u2019s pro-business reputation.",
            "The Wal-Mart case dwarfs those rulings in importance.",
            "It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court\u2019s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term."

            "The issue before the justices at Tuesday\u2019s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country\u2019s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there.",
            "For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit."
        ],
        [
            "The plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes.",
