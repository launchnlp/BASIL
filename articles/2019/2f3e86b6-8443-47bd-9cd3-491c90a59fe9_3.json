            "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House passed the Democrats\u2019 showcase anti-corruption and voting rights legislation on Friday, an expansive measure that aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box, end big money in politics and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials."
        ],

            "The sweeping legislation, passed 234-193, makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington that helped catapult Democrats into the majority.",
            "It also serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020.",
            "It has virtually no chance of passing the Senate."

            "\u201cIt\u2019s a power grab for the American people,\u201d said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation."

            "The ambitious compendium, at nearly 700 pages, includes proposals designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences.",
            "It also creates a six-to-one matching system for donations of up to $200 to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high-dollar contributions, funded by an additional fine on corporations found to have broken the law."

            "Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill \u2014 called the For the People Act or H.R. 1, to underscore its primacy \u2014 and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it.",
            "Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has branded it the \u201cDemocrat Politician Protection Act\u201d in weekly speeches, and pledged not to take up the legislation.",
            "The House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, also criticized the legislation."

        [
            "\u201cThis bill is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a speech on Friday, in an attack on \u201cthis new, Democrat, socialist majority.\u201d"

            "Democrats have also used the legislation to make clear that they believe that cleanup must start with the White House, and included several provisions jabbing at the president and homing in on a laundry list of his administration\u2019s alleged ethical abuses."

            "It would require presidents and vice presidents, as well as candidates for the nation\u2019s highest offices, to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns \u2014 Mr. Trump has released none \u2014 and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures."

            "Democrats also successfully put down an attempt by Republicans to divide the caucus and tar the legislation with a resolution expressing the sense that \u201callowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.\u201d"
