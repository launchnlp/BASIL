            "A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., has sent Ryan, R-Wis., a letter saying he\u2019s misused Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing, GOP House budget."

            "\u201cWe appreciate your willingness to talk about how Catholic social teaching can help inform effective policy in dealing with the urgent challenges facing our country,\u201d the letter states.",
            "\u201cHowever, we would be remiss \u2026 if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.\u201d"

            "Ryan, since introducing the budget last month, has talked about the doctrine in several interviews including one a couple weeks ago on the Christian Broadcasting Network."

        [
            "In that interview, he invoked the Catholic teaching of \"subsidiarity,\" saying it means \"not having big government crowd out civic society, but ... having enough space in our communities so that we can interact with each other\" and take care of people."
        ],
        [
            "\"To me, the principle of subsidiarity, which is really federalism, meaning government closest to the people governs best,\" he said."

            "The Georgetown University letter argues, though, that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching as a \u201crationale for gutting government programs.\u201d"

        [
            "The writers acknowledge that the teaching indeed calls for local-level solutions to problems but say it is \u201cnot a free pass to dismantle government\u201d and requires higher levels of government."

            "Ryan, who was raised on Social Security benefits after his father died, also on Fox News defended his budget against the conference, saying for instance that the concept of denying tax credits to illegal immigrants is merely \"following through on policy\" that has had bipartisan support."
