            "WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose experience and stability were widely seen as a balance to an unpredictable president, resigned Thursday in protest of President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Mattis had repeatedly told friends and aides over recent months that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States\u2019 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president.",
            "But on Thursday, in an extraordinary rebuke of the president, he decided that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 American troops from Syria was a step too far."
        ],
        [
            "Officials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was rebuffed.",

        [
            "\u201cMy views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held,\u201d Mr. Mattis wrote.",
            "\u201cBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\u201d"
        ],
        [
            "His resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and as a deep market slump became even worse over fears of continuing government turmoil."

        [
            "With the ousting this month of John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff, Mr. Mattis was the last of Mr. Trump\u2019s old-guard national security team — leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo, the president\u2019s second secretary of state, and John R. Bolton, the third White House national security adviser."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Trump said that Mr. Mattis, 68, will leave at the end of February, and that Mr. Mattis \u201cwas a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.\u201d"

            "It was also the first resignation over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when Cyrus Vance quit as secretary of state.",
            "Mr. Vance left over President Jimmy Carter\u2019s decision to attempt a rescue effort for American hostages in Iran that Mr. Vance considered ill-advised and that ended in tragedy."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Mattis\u2019s letter did not single out any decision.",
            "Instead, it condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power."
        ],
        [
            "He said the core of American national interests lay in \u201cproviding effective leadership to our alliances,\u201d and specifically described the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance Mr. Trump has often derided.",
            "Mr. Mattis also praised the \u201cDefeat ISIS\u201d coalition that Mr. Trump just abandoned in Syria."

            "But Mr. Mattis\u2019s core complaint was that Mr. Trump had lost sight of the importance of the competition for global power with Russia and China, who want \u201ca world consistent with their authoritarian model.\u201d"

            "Mr. Mattis was the primary author of a new American defense strategy whose central goal was to take on \u201crevisionist\u201d powers — an approach that some of Mr. Trump\u2019s former advisers say the president never fully comprehended."

        [
            "Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of Syria, which was opposed by virtually every high-level administration official but lauded by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was the last straw.",
            "Among his other concerns, Mr. Mattis viewed the withdrawal as abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and as ceding critical territory to Russia and Iran."
        ],
        [
            "No senior Pentagon official has defended the withdrawal publicly, despite requests from the White House.",

            "Mr. Mattis commanded Marines in Afghanistan and in the 2003 invasion of Iraq before becoming the head of United States Central Command, overseeing all American troops in the Middle East.",
            "Though a colorful, hard-charging advocate of aggressive offensive action, Mr. Mattis viewed a tough American posture overseas as a way to deter war, not to start them, with potential foes like Iran."

            "He favored working with allies, and often spoke of how difficult it was to conduct American policy without the benefit of friends.",
            "During his job interview with Mr. Trump in 2016, Mr. Mattis said he did not believe in torturing terrorism suspects to get information because he thought he could get more out of detainees by talking to them over a pack of cigarettes and a beer."

            "The relationship between Mr. Mattis and Mr. Trump had deteriorated for months.",

        [
            "As defense secretary, Mr. Mattis oversaw the world\u2019s most powerful military, supervising active-duty troops based in the United States and deployed worldwide, including in war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and on the Saudi border with Yemen.",

        ],
        [
            "As with Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the split with Mr. Mattis was a full turn in a relationship that once appeared strong."
