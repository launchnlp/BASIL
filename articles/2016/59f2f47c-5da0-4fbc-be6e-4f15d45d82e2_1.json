            "From his home at Mar-a-Lago, Donald J. Trump stirred up new controversy this week in the Republican presidential primary \u2014 and new alarm among party leaders that the front-runner for the nomination will drive away women from candidates running farther down the ballot in the fall."
        ],
        [
            "All week, Mr. Trump has slowly escalated a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, his main competition in the Republican race, based on an ad by a \u201csuper PAC\u201d started by people who want to stop the New York developer from getting the nomination.",
            "The spot featured an old nude photo shoot of Mr. Trump\u2019s wife Melania Trump, a former model, posing on his jet."
        ],
        [
            "Mr. Cruz has no affiliation with the super PAC, and he has denounced the ad.",
            "But Mr. Trump has continued to express disbelief.",
            "After threatening to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi Cruz, who suffered a bout of depression years ago, he retweeted a post from someone who made a side-by-side photo comparison of Mrs. Cruz at an unflattering angle, and Mrs. Trump."

        [
            "On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz repeatedly quoted from the movie \u201cThe American President\u201d to defend his wife, as she held an event and faced questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s threats.",
            "But that was before Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post with the pictures of the two women.",
            "And Mr. Cruz had finally had enough."

        [
            "Calling Mr. Trump a \u201csniveling coward,\u201d Mr. Cruz told his rival to \u201cleave Heidi the hell alone.\u201d"

        [
            "It\u2019s useful to remember the news media outrage in 2012 when Todd Akin, running as the Republican nominee for Senate in Missouri, defended what he called \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d a remark that was overwhelmingly offensive to women.",
            "Under pressure from news outlets, the Republican Party tried to cauterize the wound that Mr. Akin had created by isolating him."

        [
            "Spouses are generally seen as off limits.",
            "And the responses to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments among news media critics, over time, have been far more subdued."
