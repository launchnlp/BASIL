            "Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire after a video surfaced Tuesday of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a \u201cfarmer from Iowa who never went to law school\u201d \u2014 in the middle of Braley\u2019s campaign for Senate in the state known for its agriculture industry."

            "Braley apologized for the remarks in a written statement after the video was released.",

            "\u201cI have tremendous respect for Iowa farmers and appreciate how important they are to our state, and I\u2019m grateful to have the support of hundreds of farmers across Iowa,\u201d he said."

            "Braley says if elected to the Senate to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, he would want to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee.",

            "\u201cAlongside that, Sen. Grassley\u2019s one of only two working family farmers in the United States Senate, where he brings Iowa common sense to work for ag, anti-trust, transportation, environmental, energy, trade, health care, communications, national security, and tax policy that works for all of America,\u201d the aide said."
