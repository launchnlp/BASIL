            "WASHINGTON \u2014 Leading Democrats called Friday for President Trump to cancel his upcoming meeting with President Vladimir V.

        [
            "\u201cPresident Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression towards the United States and democracies around the world,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a statement.",
            "\u201cIf President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward.\u201d"
        ],

            "A grand jury indicted the officers on Friday, accusing them of conspiring to interfere with the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by hacking the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.",
            "The indictment is part of an open investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who is examining whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice."

            "\u201cThese indictments are further proof of what everyone but the president seems to understand: President Putin is an adversary who interfered in our elections to help President Trump win,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said, adding that Mr. Trump should cancel the meeting \u201cuntil Russia takes demonstrable and transparent steps to prove that they won\u2019t interfere in future elections.\u201d"

Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee."

        [
            "Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, stopped short of calling on Mr. Trump to cancel, but he said the president should insist that other Americans be present and should demand that Mr. Putin extradite those indicted."

            "\u201cI would not trust the president alone with Putin without some other Americans in the administration in there,\u201d he said.",

        [
            "The charges were announced here on Friday by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who made clear during a news conference that the Justice Department views the hacking not as an attack on one party, but as an attack against the United States."

        [
            "\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to avoid thinking politically, as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said.",
            "\u201cOur response must not depend on which side was victimized.\u201d"

            "All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not America\u2019s friend, and he is not the president\u2019s buddy.",

        ],
        [
            "But with the exception of Mr. McCain, Republicans steered clear of discussing whether Mr. Trump should cancel Monday\u2019s meeting in Helsinki.",
            "Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, did not have any immediate reaction, while a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said simply that Mr. Ryan was \u201cglad these hackers are being held to account.\u201d"
